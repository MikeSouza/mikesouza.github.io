It occurred to me recently that my life has had one less major annoyance due to the death of Experts-Exchange!

Ok... Maybe not death, since the site still exists... But it's as good as dead to me. I can't recall the last time I've seen it in the top search results for a technical question or problem I'm having. With the advent of StackOverflow (and the StackExchange network in general), no longer do I find myself wasting time consciously avoiding Experts-Exchange search results, or facepalming because I accidentally clicked on a search result to a paywalled Experts-Exchange Q&A. Good riddance.

Interestingly, I found this related [post](http://www.seroundtable.com/leading-blocked-sites-experts-exchange-14240.html).
