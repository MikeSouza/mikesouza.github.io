I've published the Chrome browser extension I've been working on, [FindZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/findzilla/aiandhcaoopdebbehlfhpcolegndplgo?hl=en&gl=US "FindZilla"), to Chrome Web Store.

FindZilla is a relatively simple extension that provides better "find in page" functionality than the built-in default Chrome feature. It offers case-sensitive and whole word matching options, as well as provides more accurate find results. For example, if you had a webpage with the text "ABABABA" and wanted to find all occurrences of the string "ABA". The default Chrome find in page feature would only match TWO occurrences of "ABA", but in reality there are THREE, which FindZilla correctly matches.

Any suggestions/ feature requests, comments, bug reports, etc. are much appreciated!
